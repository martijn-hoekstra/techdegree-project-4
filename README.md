OOP Game Show App

## Changes to css
- Two classes have been added for #overlay: '.won' and '.lost'. Those change the overlay background based on if the player won or lost the game.
- I've removed the border-radius of #overlay.
- Added '.disabled' class to better indicate that a previously selected letter is now disabled.
